Welcome to the website of the Old Road Journal Club. You will be able to find every information related to the ORJC meetings.

## About

The Old Road Campus Journal Club is an **informal get together session for PhD students** and any interested post docs to discuss the latest research findings in the field of biomedical research, and share work that weâ€™ve done! The journal club has a focus on **computational biology**, but we also appreciate the diversity of the field and welcome anything related to genetics and genomics. Join us every other Friday at the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics or Big Data Institute for **cool science** and **pizza & drinks**!

The Journal Club is presently run by Andrew and [Kasia](https://kasia.codes/).

We have an active mailing list to which one can subscribe by sensing an empty email with _SUBSCRIBE_ in subject line to dphil-journal-club@maillist.ox.ac.uk.
